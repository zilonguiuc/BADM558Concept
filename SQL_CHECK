here's an example of using a CHECK constraint to enforce a rule on a column that can only have a certain set of values:

Suppose you have a table called inventory that stores information about products in your inventory, including their product_id, product_name, category, and quantity. You want to ensure that the category column value can only be one of three categories: "electronics", "books", or "apparel". You can use a CHECK constraint to enforce this rule:
 
CREATE TABLE inventory (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    category VARCHAR(10) CHECK (category IN ('electronics', 'books', 'apparel')),
    quantity INT
);

In this example, the inventory table has a CHECK constraint named chk_category that ensures that the category column value is one of the allowed categories using the IN operator. If an attempt is made to insert or update a record in the inventory table with a category value that is not one of the allowed categories, the CHECK constraint will reject the insertion or update and raise an error.

This can help ensure that your data is consistent and valid, and prevent typos or other mistakes from entering incorrect values in the category column.
