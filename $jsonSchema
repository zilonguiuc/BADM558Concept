In MongoDB, you can enforce a schema on a collection using the $jsonSchema operator in a validator expression. When you create a collection with a validator expression that includes $jsonSchema, MongoDB will enforce the specified schema on all documents inserted into the collection.
Here is an example of how to create a collection with a schema using $jsonSchema:

db.createCollection("products", {
   validator: {
      $jsonSchema: {
         bsonType: "object",
         required: [ "product_name", "category", "price", "stock_quantity" ],
         properties: {
            product_name: {
               bsonType: "string",
               description: "must be a string and is required"
            },
            category: {
               bsonType: "string",
               description: "must be a string and is required"
            },
            price: {
               bsonType: "double",
               minimum: 0,
               description: "must be a double and is required"
            },
            stock_quantity: {
               bsonType: "int",
               minimum: 0,
               description: "must be an integer and is required"
            }
         }
      }
   }
})
In this example, we are creating a collection called "products" with a validator expression that includes a $jsonSchema object. The $jsonSchema object specifies the required properties for each document in the collection, as well as the data type and constraints for each property.
For example, the product_name property must be a string and is required, while the price property must be a double and greater than or equal to 0. If a document is inserted into the "products" collection that does not conform to this schema, MongoDB will reject the document and return an error message.\
Overall, using $jsonSchema in a validator expression when creating a collection in MongoDB allows you to enforce a schema on the collection and ensure that all documents inserted into the collection adhere to that schema.
